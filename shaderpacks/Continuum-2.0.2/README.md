# Continuum 2.0

This a Minecraft shaderpack. As a successor to Continuum, it is intended to lean towards high-end and cutting-edge effects, and not to worry so much about performance all the time. Continuum 2.0 is being developed by multiple experienced people, who basically work full-time on it at points; as such, we are charging money for it.
